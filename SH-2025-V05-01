#NOTE: In the total current in SH-2025-V04-06, it is ideally assumed that there is no generation or recombination of carriers
#in the space-charge (depletion) region (SCR) of a p-n junction. This makes derivation of the total current mathematically convenient.
#In reality, this is not the case. The recombination rate is the largest when p ~ n, that is, using pn = (n_i^2)exp(qV/kT), one can
#find the value of p or n. This is used as the basis to derive the recombination (generation) rate in SCR.

#Recombination (generation) Rate in SCR
R = abs((n_i/tau_dep)*((np.exp((V_app)/(2*k*T)))-1))   #-1 is present in the expression so that R = 0 when V_app = 0
